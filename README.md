## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher  
- `pip` package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

ðŸ§ª How It Works

Loads a trained machine learning pipeline (pipe.pkl) which includes preprocessing and classification model.

Takes input from the user about teams, venue, and match stats.

Calculates derived features such as runs left, balls left, current and required run rates.

Feeds these features into the model to get probabilities of winning and losing.

Displays the prediction probabilities interactively.
